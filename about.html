                        Are we a Ponzi scheme
                    </h4>
                    <p class="line ">
                        A Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent inveﬆing scam promising high rates of return with little risk to inveﬆors. The Ponzi scheme generates returns for early inveﬆors by acquiring new inveﬆors. This is similar to a pyramid scheme in that both are based on using
                        new inveﬆors' funds to pay the earlier backers.</br> Both Ponzi schemes and pyramid schemes eventually bottom out when the ﬂood of new inveﬆors dries up and there isn't enough money to go around. At that
                        point, the schemes unravel. Suponic is far from being a Ponzi scheme. It is a legitimate syﬆem aimed at creating a suﬆainable eco syﬆem for all.</br> Suponic provides game credits to users at market price of
                        <span style="color:black;font-size:22px; ">$1 USD</span> per credit. The credit scan be purchased using credit card and it can be used immediately on Suponic's signature game Ink Wars. Infact the syﬆem has an active user base who
                        plays game. This is the same as any other video games, including League of Legends, Street ﬁghter and Candy Crush. The beneﬁts of Early joiners are able to purhcase game credits at a discounted price to help grow the hype and excitement.
                        </br>
                        The game credit can also be used to purchase ingame items such as game characters, game outﬁts or game booﬆers which adds more fun to the game. Gamers can play againﬆ other gamers and can earn game credits from each other by skill based wining.

                        The Howie teﬆ is an additional protective means to protect users from unsubtantiated claims made by companies who entice users for gain without int ention of fulﬁlling their promises. It emphasises on 'subﬆance over ﬆructure' to deep dive into the underlying
                        problems that may victimize the uneducated and the vulnerable.</br>

                        <span style="color:black;">D.</span> The syﬆem has been in 13 years of development with over 28 million USD inveﬆed. The games are fully working, with Ink Wars being Suponic's siganture game. It is a family orientated bubble popping
                        game which provides hours of fun. Suponic's gaming platform provides API or game developers who wishes to make their exiﬆing video games more attractive by adding Suponic's esport features.</br>
                        <span style="color:black;">E.</span> Suponic as a company has exiﬆed for 3.5 years. Suponic is originally well known for its 3D holographic phones, soaps and cosmetic lines. Suponic was the main sponser for Korea's largeﬆ reality
                        TV series which encourages gamers to be responsible and live a healthy life ﬆyle with proper diet, recreational activities and improving ﬆrategies by attending gaming academies. The focus of the show was more on having fun rather
                        tha just wining.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Who are the early participators?</h4>
                    <p class="line">
                        Early participators are people who obtain game credits below market price during closed beta ﬆage. Their role is to bring the initial momentum in bringing a hype on what is to be a platform provider for esports gaming. Gaming is more fun when s har ed
                        with friends. With a goal to reach 3000+ concurrent gamer user base. With games like Cross Fire reaching 8 million concurrent user base, 3000 ccu is quite a conservative number to reach.</br>
                        Suponic has over 59 games on the platform with a signature game Ink Wars which consiﬆs of 28+ awesome characters with numerous items for purchase. It is free to play but requires game credit purchase for obtaining advanced characters and consumable items
                        such as power ups and decorations. The game underwent over 3 years of development, and has recieved ratings as high as 9/10 from professional esport gamers. Early supporters can participate in teﬆing the games ﬁrﬆ hand and enjoy
                        participating in game publishing.
